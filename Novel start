# The Hoard of The Dragon Queen
The air shook around Tiamat's wings, propelling her forward.
She gazed upon her work, if only for a moment.
An old human poem came to her mind,"'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'".
For she was Ozymandias, and her kingdom was gone, replaced by the walls of the nine hells holding her in here.
She had devised an escape, yet it was far away.
The Cult of Dragons shall soon save the day.
Tiamat will grow, and devour the world.
Only four adventurers, a barbarian, a fighter, a ranger, and a warlock, can stop her hunger.
They will reclaim the world for the races of men, elves, and dwarves.
It shall be the hardest battle of all time.
It shall usher in the Rise of Tiamat.
----------------------------------------Chapter 1-----------------------------------------
On-Kung, Nrimbor, Celebrimbor, and Torvin were escorting a caravan being paid 10 gp an hour, plus 200 gp bonus and 500 gp per attack repelled.
It looks like they won't get that bonus.
"Come on, just let me attack it!" Torvin said,"At least we'll get 500 bonus each!"
"No, Torvin," Nrimbor said through a sigh,"We must be honest."
Nrimbor was a ranger with a speciality crossbow and a wolf mount.
Torvin wasn't exactly right of mind, being a barbarian and all, he saw his brother killed by a legendary beast, and still has the scars.
Celebrimbor was an impropable brother of the halfing Nrimbor, being an elf and all.
On-Kung tries to help humanity and elfvish-kind, as he is a half-elf warlock.
"My wolf smells a dragon!" Nrimbor cried in disbelief,"A damned blue dragon, at Greenest!"
"I shall scout ahead," Celebrimbor yelled, almost 200 feet ahead of everyone,"I shall return with a report!"
He was not gone but 5 minutes when he returned with horrible news.
"Greenest is under attack! The Cult of Dragons is attacking with a blue dragon!"
Nrimbor sighed and said,"Uh-oh, this looks like a job for us."
The four headed of to scout out Greenest, and find what was happening.
----------------------------------------Episode 1: Greenest in Flames-----------------------------------------
The four arrived to chaos erupting around them.
Raiding parties were attempting to set fire to homes and hunting people down.
"Look, over there!" Torvin saw something, a human family being hounded by kobolds.
"Time to save them," remarked an unenthusiastic Nrimbor,"We just might get paid."
He stood out of the low brush, and fired two bolts into the skulls of some kobolds, with his wolf killing one as well.
Torvin went to town, slashing four kobolds in his anger.
Celebrimbor used Talon and cleaved a kobold in two.
"You are safe, my good madam and sir and young sirs," On-Kung said with an air of gentility.
"Um... thanks? Well, my name is Nivine, and we must get to the keep. It's the only safe place now, but not for long."
Raiders saw the small group coming, and gained an advantage.
The adventurers were outnumbered 3 to 1, but that didn't stop them.
They barrelled through all the raiders, determination filling their hearts, and becoming rage-filled screams.
Celebrimbor got to the keep first, and held off some sieging cultists, and began closing the gate.
"Oi! Stop that, Celebrimbor!" Nrimbor shouted with anger welling up.
"Then hurry up, Nrimbor!" Celebrimbor yelled in vain, realizing his brother was stupid.
Torvin crashed through and reached the keep, then Nivine, On-Kung, Nivine's husband and children, and finally Nrimbor.
"You are the fastest one, Nrimbor! How were you last?" Celebrimbor said, catching his breath.
"Ah, hello gentlemen who look well equipped to handle this threat." Everyone was startled by the booming voice.
"I am Governor Nighthill, and I need a few things done to help repel the invaders!" said Governor Nighthill.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We need to repair the sally port!" That was On-Kung's position.
"The. Old. Tunnel." Was Torvin's position.
"The sanctuary needs our help, now!" Celebrimbor said with affirmation.
"The mill will keep them running after the attack, we must do that!" So thought Nrimbor.
They eventually decided to repair the sally port, to keep the enemies from setting up an ambush.
Nrimbor knew someone who could repair the port, and went to find her.
Torvin was quite angry at On-Kung and began raging.
He battered kobolds left, right, and center.
The ambush drakes ran in fear, and the sally port was sealed.
Next up, they flushed enemies out of the old tunnel.
Then, they had to rescue the people from the the burning temple.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mob paraded around the mostly burning building, distracting from the battering ram construction.
The back door was almost ablaze, with cultists and kobolds trying to find more fuel for the flames.
The front door was barricaded against this thing, but it wouldn't hold.
"We need to disrupt them at the back, then take out the battering ram," Nrimbor said with certainty.
"We must destroy the battering ram, THEN secure the back door." On-Kung said to 'his good compatraits'.
The party decided to follow On-Kung's plan and destroy the battering ram.
A couple of kobolds were cursing out the mob, and weren't paying attention to Nrimbor.
Suddenly, a wolf lept from the bushes and killed a kobold, then Nrimbor lept out and shot the ambush drake dead.
The cultists ran away, but the kobolds stayed to fight.
Their heads then rolled on the floor.
The party then dismantled the battering ram, and Torvin, that sadist came up with a plan.
The mob turned the final corner and saw one of the cultists.
"Hello guys. Would you like to play a game? I love games."
Torvin then removed his hand out of the cultist, smiling, and said, "Games are fun, aren't they?"
The mob dispersed, terrified of the sadistic dwarf.
